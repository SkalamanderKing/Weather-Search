# Weather-Search

<h1>Final task for "Webbapplicationsutveckling"-class by Gustav Palm</h1>

This is the final task done by student Gustav Palm for the course "Webbapplicationsutveckling" at Lernia Yrkesh√∂gskola. Part of the program "Javascriptutvecklare Front-End"

This product is for the weather-nerds who want to know all about the weather around the globe. This includes functiontions so that the customer can search a city on the planet and know the weather right now, a 12 hour forecast, the uv-index at the moment and finaly know how thick the ozone-layer is over the city they querried. 

<strong>WeatherSearch uses 3 public API:s as follows:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start">Google Maps Geocode</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMaps</a></li>
</ul>

<strong>The technologies used to complete this project are following:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>HTML5 & CSS: Used to create the backbone of the sites structure and not to forget some styling.</li>
	<li>Bootstrap: I really like Bootsrap, that's why most of the styling and layout is managed by Bootstrap. The likes of the gridsystem, buttons, modals, lists are frequently used throughout the website using Bootstrap.</li>
	<li>jQuery: Mainly used for layout changes and most inportantly used for AJAX-calls to web servers to use public API:s and access their JSON-data </li>
	<li>JavaScript: Used to create and communicate with Google Maps Api</li>
</ul>

Hope you guys enjoy!
